# 3D Particle Simulation

This is my first ever C++ projectâ€”a 3D particle physics simulation!

---

## Project Overview

This application simulates particle physics in 3D space with the following features:

- **Real-time 3D rendering** with OpenGL
- **Particle-particle collision detection** and resolution
- **Interactive camera controls**
- **Adjustable physics parameters** (gravity, particle size, etc.)
- **Two boundary types**: box and sphere
- **Performance scaling** based on system capabilities

## First C++ Learning Project

This project represents my first foray into C++ programming. As a beginner, I learned:

- Object-oriented programming in C++
- Working with pointers and memory management
- OpenGL integration and shader programming
- Cross-platform development with CMake
- Physics simulation techniques

## Technical Features

### Physics Engine
- **Semi-implicit Euler integration**
- **Collision detection** with spatial partitioning
- **Fluid dynamics** using the SPH algorithm
- **Variable time stepping** for stability

### Graphics
- **Modern OpenGL rendering pipeline**
- **Custom GLSL shaders**
- **Point sprites** for efficient particle rendering
- **Real-time performance adaptation**

### User Interface
- **Interactive camera controls**
- **On-screen parameter display**
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for adjusting simulation parameters

## What I've Learned

As my first C++ project, this simulation taught me a tremendous amount about:

- C++ syntax and language features
- Building complex applications from scratch
- Graphics programming fundamentals
- Physics simulation algorithms
- Performance optimization techniques
- Modern C++ practices and tools

The particle simulation is both visually appealing and physically accurate, demonstrating principles of fluid dynamics and rigid body physics in an interactive environment.
